## Implementation Notes

- I over-debated whether the EditNote component should redirect to the ViewNote or CommunityNotes component upon submit. While it might well become annoying to return to the note after edit, people often like to review their changes before moving on. In a more fleshed out project, I might try to highlight the changes and have users confirm them rather than follow the pattern I used here, depending on what real users tended to prefer.
